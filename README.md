### 👋 Hi there! 

I'm a nonbinary software engineer who is passionate about building cool things with code. I'm currently diving deep into Python, JS, and SQL, and I'm loving every minute of it.

💬 When I'm not coding, you can ask me about Digital Marketing Strategies, Product Launches, and Customer Management. I have a keen eye for advertising and love finding creative ways to connect with customers.

😄 My pronouns are They/Them, and I'm always happy to chat with fellow tech enthusiasts about our shared love of all things code-related.

⚡ Fun fact: I'm a bit of a video game nerd, and I'm obsessed with finding platinums in my favorite games. So if you need a gaming buddy, hit me up!

Thanks for checking out my profile, and happy coding! 🚀
